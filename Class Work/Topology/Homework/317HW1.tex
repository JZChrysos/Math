\noindent \textbf{Problem 1 (Hatcher 0.4)}: A deformation retraction ``in the weak sense'' of $X\to A$ is a homotopy $f_t:X\to X$ such that $f_0$ is the identity map on $X$, $f_1$ is a map $X\to A$, and $f_t(A)\subseteq A$ for all $t\in [0,1]$ (this is weaker because it does not require $f_t$ be \textit{constant} on $A$). Show that if such a map exists, then the inclusion $\iota:A\to X$ is a homotopy equivalence.

\begin{proof}
	To show that $\iota$ is a homotopy equivalence it is sufficient and necessary to produce an inverse up to homotopy. This inverse will be $f_1$. The composition $\iota \circ f_1:X\to X$ is homotopic to $\id_X$ via $f_t$. $f_1\circ \iota:A\to A$ is also not necessarily $\id_A$, but is homotopic to $\id_A$ via $f_t$ (here we need the fact that $f_t$ is always a map $A\to A$).
\end{proof}

\noindent \textbf{Problem 2 (Hatcher 0.6)}: 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Let $X$ be the subspace of $\R^2$ consisting defined by
	$$
	X := \Big([0,1]\times \{0\} \Big) \cup \bigcup_{q\in \Q[0,1]} \{q\}\times [0,1-q].
	$$
	Show that $X$ deformation retracts to any point in $[0,1]\times \{0\}$, but not to other points in $X$.
	\item Let $Y$ be the union of an infinite number of copies of $X$ arranged as in the figure below. Show that $Y$ is contractible but does not deformation retract onto any point.
	\item Let $Z$ be the zigzag subspace of $Y$ homeomorphic to $\R$ indicated by the heavier line. Show that there is a deformation retraction $Y\to Z$ in the weak sense, but not in the regular sense.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
	(a): For any point $r\in [0,1]$, we can construct a deformation retraction from $X$ to $\{r\}\times \{0\}$ as follows: let $d_t:X\to X$ be given by
	$$
	d_t(q,h) = \begin{cases}
		(q,h(1 - 2t)) & t\in [0,\tfrac12]\\
		((2t-1)r+(2-2t)q,0) & t\in [\tfrac12,1]
	\end{cases}
	$$
	It is easy to check that $d_t$ is continuous and that $d_t((r,0)) = (r,0)$ for all $t\in[0,1]$.
	
	On the other hand, every point $x:=(q,h)$ with $h\neq 0$ has the property that there is an $\ep$ (namely $\ep=h/2$) such that within every neighborhood of $x$ there are points $y$ such that there are no paths between $y$ and $x$ within $B_{x}(\ep)$. Any point with this property cannot be the target of a deformation retraction:
	
	If there was such a deformation retraction, then for every point $y$ there is a closed time interval $T_y$ for which $d_t(y)\not\in B_{x}(\ep)$ for $t\in T_y$. Let $y_1,y_2,\dots$ be a sequence in $X$ approaching $x$. By compactness of $[0,1]$, there is a time $t$ such that $t\in T_{y_j}$ for infinitely many $y_j$. This shows $d_t$ is not continuous in $t$ at $x$, since $|d_t(x)-d_t(y)|>\ep$ for arbitrarily small $|x-y|$. Thus such a deformation retraction cannot exist.\\
	
	(b): The difference between being contractible to a point $x$ and being \textit{deformation retractable} to $x$ is that in the former case, the homotopy need not keep $x$ fixed. $Y$ is contractible because it is a 1-dimensional CW complex with no cycles (i.e. a tree). Yet it is not deformation retractable to any point because every point of $Y$ has the property described in the second part of (a).\\
	
	(c): Here is a somewhat vague description of a weak deformation retraction to $Z$: every point $y\in Y$ has a single always-rightward path which extends to infinity through $Y$, so we let every point simultaneously walk along this path at the same constant rate. As a result, the ``bristles'' move together with the parallel section of $Z$, making the map continuous. At time $t=1$, the bristles will have all rejoined $Z$, making this a weak deformation retraction. But all points in $Z$ also moved, so it is not a true deformation retraction.
\end{proof}

\noindent \textbf{Problem 3 (Hatcher 0.16)}: Show that $S^{\infty}$ is contractible.
\begin{proof}
	Let $x$ be the single point in the $0$-skeleton of $S^{\infty}$. Let $A_k^+,A_k^-$ be the upper and lower open half-$k$-sphere, so that $A_k^+\cap A_k^-=S^{k-1}$ and all $A_k^{\pm}$ contain $x$. Every loop at $x$ in $S^{\infty}$ is entirely contained in $A_k^+$ or $A_k^-$ for some finite $k$, and thus contractible to $x$. Thus $S^{\infty}$ is also contractible.
\end{proof}
\newpage 


\noindent \textbf{Problem 4 (Hatcher 0.20)}: Show that the space $X\subset \R^3$ formed by a Klein bottle intersecting itself in a circle is homotopy equivalent to $S^1\vee S^1 \vee S^2$.
\begin{proof}
	We can think of this Klein bottle embedded in $\R^3$ as a square with the usual Klein bottle edge-gluing and an additional identification of two disjoint circles.
\end{proof}
\newpage 


\noindent \textbf{Problem 5 (Hatcher 0.23)}: Show that a CW complex is contractible if it is the union of two contractible subcomplexes whose intersection is also contractible.

\begin{proof}
	Let $X,Y$ be two contractible CW-complexes with intersection $Z$, and let $x\in Z$. If $\ell$ is a loop at $x$ in $X\cup Y$, then 
\end{proof}
