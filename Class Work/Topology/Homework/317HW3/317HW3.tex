\textbf{Problem 1 (Hatcher 1.2:9)}: In the surface $M_g$ of genus $g$, let $C$ be a circle that separates $M_g$ into two compact surfaces $M_h'$ and $M_k'$ obtained from the closed surfaces $M_h$ and $M_k$ by deleting an open disk from each. Show that $M_h'$ does not retract onto $C$, and hence $M_g$ does not retract onto $C$. But show that $M_g$ does retract onto the non-separating circle $C'$ in the figure.

\begin{proof}
	We know that $\pi_1(M_g)$ can be presented as
	$$
	\pi_1(M_g) = \<a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2,\dots,a_g,b_g \; | \; [a_1,b_1][a_2,b_2]\cdots [a_g,b_g]\>.
	$$
	The Abelianization of this is $\Z^{2g}$. If $M_h'$ retracts onto $C$, then \\
	
	On the other hand, for $C'$, there is a retraction given by

\textbf{Problem 2 (Hatcher 1.2:11)}: The mapping torus $T_f$ of a map $f:X\to X$ is the quotient of $X\times I$ obtained by identifying each point $(x,0)$ with $(f(x),1)$. In the case $X=S^1\vee S^1$ with $f$ preserving the basepoint, compute a presentation for $\pi_1(T_f)$ in terms of the induced map $f_*:\pi_1(X)\to\pi_1(X)$. Do the same when $X=S^1\times S^1$.
\begin{proof}
	$T_f$ has a CW-complex construction with a single 0-cell $x$, two 1-cells $\a$ and $\b$, and two 2-cells which attach via $f$, giving the relations $\a = f_*(\a)$ and $\b=f_*(\b)$. So the group presentation is 
	$$
	\pi_1(T_f) = \<\a,\b \; | \; \a = f_*(\a),\; \b = f_*(\b)\>.
	$$
	When $X=S^1\times S^1$, we start with the free abelian group on two generators $\Z^2$ and again identify $\a=f_*(\a)$ and $\b=f_*(\b)$, giving
	$$
	\pi_1(T_f) = \<\a,\b \; | \; \a = f_*(\a), \; \b = f_*(\b), \; \a\b=\b\a \>.
	$$
\end{proof}

\textbf{Problem 3 (Hatcher 1.2:14)}: Consider the quotient space $X$ of a cube $I^3$ obtained by identifying each square face with the opposite square face via a clockwise quarter-rotation and translation by one unit. Show that $X$ is a cell complex with two $0$-cells, four $1$-cells, three $2$-cells, and one $3$-cell. Using this structure, show that $\pi_1(X)$ is the quaternion group.
\begin{proof}
	The cells are as in the diagram:
	$$
	\textbf{Diagram goes here}
	$$
	
	In the 1-skeleton, $X^1$ has 4 edges $a,b,c,d$. The fundamental group $\pi_1(X^1)$ is generated by 
	$$
	i := ab^{-1}, \; j := ac^{-1}, \; k = ad^{-1}.
	$$
	The attaching maps of the three 2-cells yield the relations
	$$
	ad^{-1}bc^{-1} = 1, \;\; ac^{-1}db^{-1}=1, \;\; ab^{-1}cd^{-1} = 1.
	$$
	Translating this to $i,j,k$, we can say $j = ac^{-1} = bd^{-1} = ba^{-1}ad^{-1} = i^{-1}k \Rightarrow ij = k$. Likewise,
	$$
	i = jk, \;\; j = ki, \;\; k = ij.
	$$
	And we also have 
	\begin{align*}
		kji &= (ad^{-1})ac^{-1}ab^{-1}\\
		&= c(b^{-1}ac^{-1})ab^{-1}\\
		&= cd^{-1}ab^{-1}\\
		&= 1
	\end{align*}
	(this can be seen as a deformation of the loop in the diagram). Thus, $i,j,k$ obey the group presentation for $Q$: note that
	$$
	i^2 = ijk = k^2 = kij = j^2
	$$
	and 
	$$
	(ijk)^2 = (ij)(ki)(jk) = kji = 1.
	$$
\end{proof}

\textbf{Problem 4 (Hatcher 1.2:16)}: Show that the fundamental group of the surface of infinite genus is free on an infinite number of generators.
\begin{proof}
	Similarly to the surfaces of finite genus, we can give a CW complex structure to the surface $M_{\omega}^+$ with infinite genus \textit{in one direction}: one 0-cell $x$, infinitely many 1-cells $a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2,\dots$, and a single 2-cell which attaches via $$a_1b_1a_1^{-1}b_1^{-1}a_2b_2a_2^{-1}b_2^{-1}\cdots$$
	This makes $\pi_1(M_{\omega}^+)=\Z^{\omega}$, as this infinite product of commutators is not actually a group element.\\
	
	Now to get the fundamental group of $M_{\omega}$, which has infinitely many holes extending in both directions: we can write $M_{\omega}\simeq M_{\omega}^+\vee M_{\omega}^+$, so by Van Kampen's Theorem,
	$$\pi_1(M_{\omega})=\Z^{\omega}\oplus \Z^{\omega} = \Z^{\omega+\omega} = \Z^{\omega}.$$
\end{proof}

\textbf{Problem 5 (Hatcher 1.2:22)}: In this exercise, we describe an algorithm for computing the \textit{Wirtinger presentation} of the fundamental group of the complement of a knot in $\R^3$. We begin with the knot lying almost flat on a table $T$ so that $K$ consists of finitely-many disjoint arcs $\a_i$ contained within $T$ and finitely-many $\b_{\ell}$ which leave $T$ to cross over another part of $K$. We build a 2-dimensional complex $X$ that is a deformation retract of $\R^3-K$ in the following steps:\\

For each $\a_i$, let $R_i$ be a curved rectangle so that its long edges are on $T$ and it has $\a_i$ underneath it, and let and $\b_{\ell}$ crossing over $\a_i$ lie along the curve of $R_i$. For each $\b_{\ell}$, let $S_{\ell}$ be the square-shaped piece which covers the crossing. Let $X$ be the union of $T$, $R_i$, and $S_{\ell}$ for all $i,\ell$. Lift $K$ off the table slightly so that it does not intersect $X$. Then we can deformation retract $R^3-K$ to $X$.\\

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Assuming that this retraction is possible, show that $\pi_1(\R^3-K)$ has a presentation with one generator $x_i$ for each $R_i$ and one relation $x_ix_jx_i^{-1}=x_k$ whenever $\a_j,\a_k$ are two pieces which cross over $\a_i$ via some $\b_{\ell}$.
	\item Use this presentation to show that the Abelianization of $\pi_1(\R^3-K)$ is $\Z$.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
	(a): By the deformation retraction, $\pi_1(\R^3-K)=\pi_1(X)$.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Problem 6 (Hatcher 1.B:5)}: Consider the graph of groups $\Gamma$ having one vertex $\Z$ and one edge $n\mapsto 2n$. Show that $\pi_1(K\Gamma)$ has presentation $\<a,b|bab^{-1}a^{-2}\>$ and describe the universal cover of $K\Gamma$ explicitly as a product $T\times \R$ with $T$ a tree.

\newpage
\textbf{Problem 7 (Hatcher 2.1:5)}: Compute the simplicial homology groups of the Klein bottle using the $\Delta$-complex structure.

\newpage
\textbf{Problem 8 (Hatcher 2.1:8)}: Construct a 3-dimensional $\Delta$-complex $X$ from $n$ tetrahedra $T_1,\dots,T_n$, with all sharing a common edge and each sharing a face with its two neighbors. Show that the simplicial homology groups of $X$ in dimensions 0,1,2,3 are $\Z,\Z_n,0,\Z$ respectively.

\newpage 
\textbf{Problem 9 (Hatcher 2.1:11)}: Show that if $X$ is a retract of $X$ then the map $H_n(A)\to H_n(X)$ induced by the inclusion $A\subset X$ is injective.
